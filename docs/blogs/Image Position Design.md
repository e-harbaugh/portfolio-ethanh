# Image Position Design

While we were considering the waze example (about choosing to stagger text or keep it on one side) the question became apparent to as to why the images were on the left side (for the example where they were all on the same side).

We had discussed in class how our eyes follow an F pattern, starting at the left and moving across as we discover useful info. When you add this to the idea of information architecture, immediately it would seem to me that you would want (and it would benefit users) to have the text and headings on the left with the supplementary images on the right, however upon doing some research I discovered it is a bit more complicated.  
Different sources cite different reasons for choosing an image layout, <a href="[url](https://medium.com/@CallaghanDesign/left-or-right-824aee5f96c9)">this article</a> explores how to best design around natural eye movement, but lands on a very different conclusion. Essentially, it states that the movement from right back to the left side of the screen can be difficult when going from more apealing colorful elements to text and information. So while we want users to focus on the information, it actually can work better to let them encounter the image first in a position where the inclination to "follow to the next point" is stronger.

<a href="[url](https://www.impactplus.com/blog/aligning-copy-and-visuals)">Another article</a> which focuses on small tips to improve visual usage has a much stronger view on the importance of visuals. One interesting point it makes is that visuals should be designed with their eventual position in mind, and point the reader where they should go next, giving the example below:

As the article claims the baby's gaze points you toward the text. Reagardless I've found that there is no simple best answer when it comes to positioning for text and image integration.
