# Assignment 2: Divergent Design

## Goals

### App name: OpenHaven

### Audience
The intended audience is users looking to build and maintain relationships that occur primarily in the digital environment. From my interviews, there seem to be spaces to explore content with anonymity and to share life events with people who you already have a relationship with, but most apps lack features to provide space for richer interaction more akin to how relationships are formed in everyday interaction. 

### Value
The primary value of OpenHaven is the control it will give users over the many interpersonal aspects that other platforms lack (Examples of possibilities include relationship definitions for other users like acquaintance, friend, like-family or personalized options for the content that is displayed). Additionally, its focus on creating options for richer interconnection will open space for users to better express themselves and to get to know others as “they want to be known.”


## Comparables
![Pinterest Board](images/A2/pinterest%20board.png)
The create board feature from Pinterest allowing you to group content: could we use this idea to give users a way to organize the posts from other users?

![comparable](images/A2/instagram%20caught%20up.jpg)
Instagram you’re all caught up – Instagram lets users know when they’ve seen all posts newer than a certain time period: could this be used to let users know when they have seen all unseen posts from a feed?

![comparable](images/A2/facebook%20post%20privacy.png)
Facebook post privacy – Facebook allows users to control who can see users post: could we use this to create “content groups” for users to specify for what user relationships a post should be available?

![comparable](images/A2/Facebook%20groups.png)
Facebook groups – Facebook allows users to join groups centered around specific topics: could we use this to allow users to connect over mutual interests?

![comparable](images/A2/Discord%20Voice%20Channel.jpg)
Discord calling – Discord allows users to use voice chat in rooms associated with a server: could we use this to allow users to talk with others in a community without needing to share additional information?

![comparable](images/A2/google%20docs%20share.png)
Google drive share – Google drive allows people to share access to files so that they can collaborate on them: could we use this to make richer content types with more than one author?

![comparable](images/A2/polleverywhere%20cloud.png)
Poll Everywhere word cloud – Poll everywhere allows feedback to be compiled into visualized responses: could we use this to allow users to choose more diverse methods of possible responses to their content?

![comparable](images/A2/google%20album.jpg)
Google images albums – Google images albums allow users to invite other to add photos: could we allow users to create collections of media and add others for shared events or experiences?

![comparable](images/A2/Medium%20add%20to%20publication.png)
Medium add to publication – Medium allows posters to add to their content after it has been uploaded: could we use this to allow users to create follow specific lines of content? (i.e. a story someone is writing or updates about a vacation)

![comparable](images/A2/Reddit%20post%20flair.jpg)
Reddit post flair – Reddit allows for the creation of post flairs which help users identify the type of content a post will contain: could we use this to allow users to sort and find certain types of posts?

![comparable](images/A2/Discord%20activities.png)
Discord Activities – Discord integrates games into their voice calling channels: could we use this to create content types users interact with and affect for others?

## Feature list

User-defined relationships – Allow users to create types of relationships in their settings and assign them to other users. These options will allow users to create groups of specific settings from other customizable features (See user visibility control and customizable notification settings for examples) to manage complexity while still yielding control to the user.

Post flairs – Users can assign post flairs (small descriptive tags) to content they create to inform others of the type of content and to use as a flag for other features to interpret.

User visibility control – Provides visibility options for a user’s information and posts based on attributes of their post and their relationship with the viewer. Allows users to control who can see specific aspects of their platform presence.

Customizable notification settings – Options for control of what notifications users receive based on properties of the post and the poster. Provides users with options to ensure they are informed about the specific things they want to be.

Saving notifications – Settings to save classes of notifications a user might receive. Allows users to have extended periods of non-use without the worry of missing updates on others.

End of feed notifications – A banner appears when users have exhausted all new posts in a feed. This notifies users that they have seen all new updates and gives space to combat scroll paralysis.

Longform content – Format options without limits on length/quantity. Users can select these formats to create content that is unable to fit within typical sharing limits.

Collaborative content – Users can invite others to collaborate on post content. Allows for the creation of communal content from multiple users (i.e. a set of photos from a shared trip, a story written by multiple authors) 

Interactive content – Content types that respond to viewer input and change either locally (just for that user) or globally (for all viewers). Creates opportunities for interesting interactions between the poster, their audience, and even between audience members.

Customizable reaction types – Options for selecting what types of reactions viewers can make to a post (comments, pictures, links to other posts/websites, recommendations, etc.). Allows users to tailor responses for more diverse and relevant communication. 

Reaction summaries – Options for generating creative summaries of content responses to be visible together with the original content (Such as word clouds or a list of the most popular responses). Allows the poster and other viewers to better understand the composition of responses, especially with high quantities.

Post chapters – Possibility for creators to link posts as a part of a series. Other users can then easily find and follow chapters of a line of posts.

Audience generated content – Content types which start as “blank slates” and evolve with audience input. Allows for users to more intentionally interact with those they are connected with.

Interaction histories – Users can see a history of interactions they’ve shared with another user. Allows people to better understand and remember relationships with others as they occur on the platform.

Content boards – Users can group content based on its properties to create explorable boards/feeds. Allows users with different distinct purposes/communities to explore each independently

Content communities – Posts can be made in specific public communities, created and moderated by users. Communities allow people to share content relevant to certain topics and meet others with mutual interests.

Content community voice chat – Communities can set up rooms where users can join communal voice chat. This gives users the control to better explore relationships with other users in a community without needing to expose their outside presence.

Time capsules – Users can create and invite others to create time capsules with content on the platform. After a set amount of time, the platform will share the set with them allowing for opportunities of reflection.



## Value Sensitive Design
Stakeholders: Non-targeted Use. The emphasis on control and privacy that features like user visibility control and content community voice chat could create easier avenues for nefarious actors to mislead others using the limited information. It may be pertinent to include some private verification information so that these actors can be identified.

Time: Long-Term Health and Well-Being. As the app is designed to foster and maintain digital relationships, it may cause some people to put less effort into physical ones. Current social media research shows that this can be very harmful, and intentional effort needs to be put in to change either the underlying cause or how use over time may affect an individual. Extending the ways in which users interact could foster less superficial communication.

Pervasiveness: Diverse Geographies. It’s likely the app will be innately more useful in regions where people meet less frequently due to physical or cultural barriers. In more urban settings it may be helpful to create communities based around specific locations or activities tied to them to enhance the ways in which relationships already form and improve access to others with similar interests.

Pervasiveness: Widespread Use. With more users, people will be able to better find communities with similar interests, develop more interesting uses of collaborative and adaptive content may be invented, and decide that seeking deeper relationships may become the norm for social media use. Some breakdowns that might occur include how information marked as private may be shared outside of the app for “very popular” users, with many friends it may become harder to manage the detailed settings for relationships and notifications, and longform content may become overwhelming as more people begin generating it. To combat some of these the app could have an option to simplify the user settings.

Values: Choose Desired Values. For this app, the most important values are privacy, self-efficacy, and expression. The app is designed to allow people to express themselves how they want and exactly where and when they want to. It’s very important that users don’t feel urged to interact beyond what they are seeking, and while additional values like community and cooperation are important to the app, they fall secondary to these crucial values for the population the app is designed for. To ensure this, visibility and relationship settings could be extended.
