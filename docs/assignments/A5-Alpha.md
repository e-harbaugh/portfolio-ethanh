# Assignment 5 Alpha

## Hueristics

### Usability criteria
#### Discoverability
<ul>
<li>The app opens with clear labels making it easy to find features using buttons clearly laid out as a hierachy of menus.</li>
<li>The filter interface's labels (like who, what, etc.) are not entirely clear. They sacrifice some discoverabiliy for pleasantness and efficiency.</li>
<li>While features generally fall under the menu labels they are associated with, to find posts from communities you use the view posts option as opposed to the community section which can certainly cause confusion.</li>
</ul>

#### Pleasantness
<ul>
<li>The post and community listings are very simple and calming compared to many popular interfaces.</li>
<li>The buttons on the navigation pages are so large they appear daunting. While this potentially improves efficiency for reuse, it is somewhat unpleasant.</li>
<li>The pages with input fields (for filtering and exploring) are similar creating a unified aesthetic, however this causes problems for safety in using the app as users can easily mistake one input page for another.</li>
</ul>

### Physical Heuristics
#### Fitt's Law
<ul>
<li>Buttons and text boxes take up a large proportion of the screen making them require less precision to use.</li>
<li>On the menu and field screens there exist inputs/buttons near the top of the screen requiring a user to either reposition a standard grip or use a second hand to access. This sacrifice is caused by the elements' large size (as they need to be moved up) and helps improve discoverability and error tolerance when using them.</li>
</ul>

#### Gestalt Principles
<ul>
<li>On screens where there is an enter/confirm button it is placed significantly below other elements to indicate the significance of its action.</li>
<li>The create and filter screens have a strong degree of similarity (in layout and element design) while they hold very different sgnificance contradicting the usage of similiarity but increasing pleasantness. </li>
</ul>

### Linguistic Level
#### Speak a user's language
<ul>
<li>The terminology around communities provide helpful anologies to real-world communities and instances from other applications.</li>
<li>Allowing users to set their own names and settings for relationships gives them the power to shape the interface language to their liking but create a less efficient user experience for making and managing them.</li>
<li>The labels for filtering and searching inputs are vague if you are not familiar with the concepts they are expressing and are prone to misconceptions between user and system models.</li>
</ul>

#### Information Scent
<ul>
<li>The options users have for creating their own posts and communities helps them structure how they interact with the interface to look for content from others and the things they see other users do can be applied to their own settings.</li>
<li>The filter menus expose explicitly the aspects about content that are important to help the user create a strong model of the system.</li>
</ul>
