# Assignment 3: Convergent Design

## Pitch
OpenHaven is an app designed for those looking build and maintain deep relationships that occur primarily in the digital environment. Compared to other social media platforms, OpenHaven gives users much more agency in how they use the app and communicate with others and provides options for richer interaction. The first of several key features that support this is a user-defined relationship system which allows the privacy and visibillity options to be customized and applied using relationship labels. Furthermore, OpenHaven allows collaborative posts and more reply types than simply comments to encourage unique and meaningful interaction between users. The goal is to provide a safe haven of user control for people to explore.

## Functional Design

### <b>Concept: </b> Relationshipping  
<b>Purpose: </b> Allow users to create their own relationships  
<b>Principle: </b> After creating a relationship and assigning creator and targets, looking up that pair will yield the relationship.  
<b>State: </b>  
relationTypes: creatir -> relationship  
relatedUsers: relationship -> target   
<b>Actions: </b>  
* createRelationship(creator: String, relationship: String): relates creator to new relationship in relationTypes
* relate(creator: String, target: String, relationship: String): relates selected relationship under creator to target and removes instances of that target from other relationships (for the same creator)  
* deleteRelationship(creator: String, relationship: String): removes a relationship from relationTypes  
* getRelationship(creator: String, target: String): returns relationships that relates creator to target

### <b>Concept: </b> Privacy Controlling [Thing]  
<b>Purpose: </b> Control what users can see  
<b>Principle: </b> After creating a privacy attribute for an thing and assigning a vlue, one can check and find that atrribute and value using the thing  
<b>State: </b>  
privacyAttribute: thing -> String
privacyValue: privacyAttribute -> String  
<b>Actions: </b>  
* createAttribute(thing: Thing, attribute: String): relates attribute with thing in attributes 
* assignAttribute(thing: Thing, attribute: String, value: String): relates value with attribute related to thing 
* satisfies(thing: Thing, {checkAttribute: String, checkValue: String}*): returns True if checkAttribute is not related to thing or if checkValue is related to checkAttribute related to thing, else False.
* deleteAttribute(thing: Thing, attribute: String): unrelates attribute with thing in privacyAttribute  

### <b>Concept: </b> Posting [Content]
<b>Purpose: </b> Allow users to create content for others to see  
<b>Principle: </b> After adding a piece of content it can be found using its creator  
<b>State: </b>  
post: set String
content: post -> <b>one</b> Content  
creator: post -> <b>one</b> user  
<b>Actions: </b>  
* createPost(content: Content, user: String): creates an id, adds it to the set of posts, and relates it to content and its user
* updatePost(post: String, content: Content): changes content associated with post to content  
* deletePost(post: String): removes post from post and content
* getPosts(user: String): returns all posts related to user  
* getCreator(post: String): returns creator related to post

### <b>Concept: </b> Collaborating [Object]
<b>Purpose: </b> Allows users besides the creator to edit objects  
<b>Principle: </b> After being added to the list of collaborators for an object, one can find that collaborator in the list by using the object  
<b>State: </b>     
collaborators: Object -> user  
<b>Actions: </b>  
* addColab(user: String, object: Object): relates user to object in collaborators  
* removeColab(user: String, object: Object): removes relation between user and object in collaborators  
* checkColab(user: String, object: Object): returns if the user is a collaborator on an object  

### <b>Concept: </b> Inviting [Thing]
<b>Purpose: </b> Allows users to send invites to other users to accept or decline  
<b>Principle: </b> After sending an invite for a Thing to target, target can be found using Thing  
<b>State: </b>  
invites: user -> Thing  
<b>Actions: </b>  
* inviteUser(user: String, thing: Thing): relates user to Thing in invites  
* deleteInvite(user: String, thing: Thing): unrelates user to Thing in invites  
* checkInvites(user: String): returns all relations to user in invites  

### <b>Concept: </b> Content Communitying [Object]
<b>Purpose: </b> Create communities where content can be assigned
<b>Principle: </b> After a community is created and an object is added, that object can be found using the community 
<b>State: </b>  
community: set String
posts: community -> Object  
<b>Actions: </b>  
* createCommunity(community: String): adds community to set
* addObject(community: String, object: Object): relates community and object
* removeObject(community: String, object: Object): unrelates community and object
* getPosts(community: String): returns all objects related to a community

### <b>Concept: </b> Replying [Object]
<b>Purpose: </b> Content can be created as a response to other content  
<b>Principle: </b> After adding an object and selecting an object to reply to, the new object can be found using the other object  
<b>State: </b>  
reply: set Object  
replies: Object -> reply  
<b>Actions: </b>  
* addReply(reply: Object): adds reply to the set of objects  
* removeReply(reply: Object): deletes reply from the set of objects  
* assignReply(object: Object, reply:Reply): relates reply with object in replies  
* removeReply(object: Object, reply:Reply): unrelates reply with object in replies   

## Synchronizations
Below I've provided relevant examples of synchronizations excluding operation inverses and those with less novel interactions to prevent this section from becoming excessive. Below are possible instantiations of utilized generic concepts:  
Content: Different content types coming from unlisted content creation concepts  
Object: Post, Reply  
Thing: Object, Content Community  

### Post(user, content, privacy):  
object = posting.createpost(content, user)  
privacyControlling.assignPrivacy(object, privacy)  

### PostCommunity(user, content, community): 
relation = Relationshipping.getRelationship(community, user)  
assert(PrivacyControlling.satisfies(community, {community: relation}))  
ContentCommunitying.addObject(community, content)  

### ViewCreatorPosts(user, creator, filter)
posts = Posting.getPosts(creator)  
relation = Relationshipping.getRelationship(creator, user)  
for post in posts:  
>viewable = PrivacyControlling.satisfies(post, {relationship: relation})
    passFilter = PrivacyControlling.satisfies(post, filter)
    if (not viewable or not passFilter):
        posts.remove(post)    

return posts

### ViewCommunityPosts(user, community, filter)
posts = ContentCommunitying.getPosts(community)  
relation = Relationshipping.getRelationship(community, user)  
for post in posts:  
>viewable = PrivacyControlling.satisfies(community, {community: relation})  
    passFilter = PrivacyControlling.satisfies(community, filter)  
    if (not viewable or not passFilter): posts.remove(post)  

return posts

### InvitePost(user, inviter, post)
assert(  
>Posting.getCreator(post) === inviter or  
    Collaborating.checkColab(inviter, post)  
)

Inviting.inviteUser(user, post)

### InviteCommunity(user, inviter, community)
relation = Relationshipping.getRelationship(community, user)  
assert(  
>PrivacyControlling.satisfies(community, {community: relation})  
)  

Inviting.inviteUser(user, community)

## ViewInvites(user)
return Inviting.checkInvites(user)

### AcceptInvitePost(user, post)
assert(post in Inviting.checkInvites(user))
Inviting.deleteInvite(user, post)
Collaborating.addColab(user, post)

### AcceptInviteCommunity(user, community)
assert(community in Inviting.checkInvites(user))
Inviting.deleteInvite(user, community)
Relationshipping.relate(community, user, {community: member})

### EditPost(user, post, new)
assert(  
>Posting.getCreator(post) === user or  
    Collaborating.checkColab(user, post)  
)  

Posting.updatePost(post, content)

### Reply(user, creator, post, reply)
relation = Relationshipping.getRelationship(creator, user)  
assert(PrivacyControlling.satisfies(post, {replying: relation}))  
Replying.reply(reply)  
assignReply(post, reply)

## Design Tradeoffs

### Customizability vs. Convenience
Options for presenting posts to users:  
* Search each individually
* Display all posts of related users
* Guess what posts users want to see
* Provide options for filtering current post feed  
I chose to provide options for filtering current post feed as it alligned best with the goals for OpenHaven. While it creates extra menus and possibly confusion it is important for users to have deliberate control over what they see. Therefore I chose to add extra steps and options to give users more control.

### Usability vs. Freedom
Options for allowing users to create filters and relations:  
* Create several for entire user base
* Set a number limit for different options
* Allow any number of types  
I chose to allow users to create an unlimited number of relations and filter tags based on strings. This allows users immense flexibility in how they chose to use them, but at a certain point creating too many will cause them to lose their utility in categorizing other users and posts. Regardless I chose to give users this agency so that they can create the spaces they want to interact with minimal limitations.

### Privacy vs. Relatability
Options for revealing user relations to each other:  
* Make public
* Have options to be public
* Allow for alliases
* Remain private  
I chose to keep user-defined relations private to other users. While for most other options I favored customizability and relational aspects, this was necessary to prevent users from pressuring each other into setting specific options or creating certain labels. While this maintains some level of user control, it prevents the many positive interactions that could occur from allowing relations to be public and forces a specific choice on users.
